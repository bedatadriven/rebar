/**
 * Encapuslates the mapping of an embedded class, including embedded ids.
 * <p><strong>From the specification: 2.1.5</strong></p>
 * <p>An entity may use other fine-grained classes to represent entity state. Instances of these classes,
 * unlike entity instances themselves, do not have persistent identity. Instead, they exist only as
 * embedded objects of the entity to which they belong. Such embedded objects belong strictly to
 * their owning entity, and are
 * not sharable across persistent entities. Attempting to share an embedded object across
 * entities has undefined
 * semantics. Because these objects have no persistent identity, they are typically mapped together
 * with the entity instance to which they belong.[10]
 * Embeddable classes must adhere to the requirements specified in Section 2.1 for entities with the
 * exception
 * that embeddable classes are not annotated as Entity. Embeddable classes must be annotated as
 * Embeddable or denoted in the XML descriptor as such. The access type for an embedded object is
 * determined by the access type of the entity in which it is embedded. <strong>Support for only one level of
 * embedding is required by this specification.</strong>
 * Additional requirements on embeddable classes are described in section 9.1.34.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p><strong>From the specification 9.1.34:</strong></p>
 * <p>The Embeddable annotation is used to specify a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part
 * of an owning entity and share the identity of the entity. Each of the persistent properties or fields of the
 * embedded object is mapped to the database table for the entity. Only Basic, Column, Lob, Temporal,
 * and Enumerated mapping annotations may portably be used to map the persistent fields or
 * properties of classes annotated as Embeddable</p>
